The [eeGeo SDK](http://www.eegeo.com/developers/) is a cross-platform, OpenGL-based library for [beautiful and customisable 3D maps](http://www.eegeo.com).

This repository demonstrates a selection of individual features of the eeGeo SDK on both iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

See the links below for instructions for getting started on each platform.

Platform            | Languages
--------------------|-----------------
[Android](/android) | C++, Java
[iOS](/ios)         | C++, Objective-C

## SDK Examples

When running the application, you can use the "Next" and "Previous" buttons to cycle through the examples, or tap the name of the example to open a drop-down menu.

There are 39 examples, each demonstrating a different feature of the SDK. You can find the source for them in the [src/Examples](https://github.com/eegeo/mobile-sdk-harness/tree/master/src/Examples) directory.

For a demonstration of a complete application, see the [eeGeo Example App](https://github.com/eegeo/mobile-example-app). It displays a variety of SDK features and is a good starting point to learn how the SDK works.

## SDK Documentation
